# Ensure-HTTPS

This is a little utility package that creates an HTTP-Server that directly redirects to an HTTPS server. We use this, because our entire site is running under HTTPS. Of course when users type an address into their browser, or external people link to us, they often do not specify the protocol so HTTP is used. So we use this little server to redirect every HTTP URL to its HTTPS equivalent.

## Usage

    var ensure=require('ensure-https');
    var options={
      'forceHost':undefined,   // If this is set then the destination URL is forced to this hostname
      'host':'localhost',      // This is the default host to use (for HTTP/0.9 clients) (default: localhost)
      'sslPort':443,           // This is the port of your HTTPS server if it is not 443 (default: 443)
      'statusCode':301         // This is the HTTP Status-Code to use                    (defualt: 301)
    };
    var server=ensure.createServer(options);
    server.listen(80);
