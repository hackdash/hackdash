  "readme": "# Ensure-HTTPS\n\nThis is a little utility package that creates an HTTP-Server that directly redirects to an HTTPS server. We use this, because our entire site is running under HTTPS. Of course when users type an address into their browser, or external people link to us, they often do not specify the protocol so HTTP is used. So we use this little server to redirect every HTTP URL to its HTTPS equivalent.\n\n## Usage\n\n    var ensure=require('ensure-https');\n    var options={\n      'forceHost':undefined,   // If this is set then the destination URL is forced to this hostname\n      'host':'localhost',      // This is the default host to use (for HTTP/0.9 clients) (default: localhost)\n      'sslHost':443,           // This is the port of your HTTPS server if it is not 443 (default: 443)\n      'statusCode':301         // This is the HTTP Status-Code to use                    (defualt: 301)\n    };\n    var server=ensure.createServer(options);\n    server.listen(80);\n\n## License\n\nMIT License\n-----------\n\nCopyright (C) 2012 YOUSURE Tarifvergleich GmbH\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
